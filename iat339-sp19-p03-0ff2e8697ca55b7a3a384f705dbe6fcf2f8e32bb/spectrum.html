                This system is called “Symbiosis”, a smart device for the home that connects human and nature. The Symbiosis
helps the user to keep track of their loved plants and promote the awareness of self-love. In this
device, the plant is a symbol of the user’s well being.

                we did some research, and came up with the features that we wanted to develop with the system. As well as
                how the user is going to interact with those features. The plant status based on soil moisture
                and light can be monitored through a screen and helps maintain the plant’s life. To water the
                plant, the user is required to dispense water from a water dispenser to activate the watering
                system. The statistics on the screen concludes how a user cares about oneself and the plant.

              The GUI will be displayed on computer, it communicates between the device and the
user. The user can modify the setting by inserting data through the processing
application. The GUI will visualize the plant’s health status, and also reminds the user to
water the plant by drinking water, or give the plant some light.
A second monitor will be attached to a wooden platform, displaying the current humidity
and illumination statistics of the plant. Ex. ”Moist: 30%; Status: Safe.

                From the feedback that we got from the class,
                we ended up changing the alarm feature into a carbon monoxide detector which will be more
                useful in different space at home, not only bedroom.

            <p>
                We spent a lot time trying to figure out why our LCD display is not working, and tried different code
                and different libraries. With TA’s help, it ended up was the soldering that was not done properly.
                Soldering was the first step which we had to connect two parts together, so when something is wrong, we
                need to always think it though again to find the problem.

            <p>
                I think this project was done well, we did put a lot effort within this seven weeks and we did learn a
                lot from it. First of all, doing what we would be enjoy doing was important. My major role for this
                project was the coding part, and I did encounter a lot of problems, but learned a lot as well with these
                two program application: Processing and Arduino. From struggling with the LCD display, I learned that if
                you can’t find the reason why something is not working, always check everything from the beginning and
                you will find out. </p>
