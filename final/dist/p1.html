              In a group of 3, we were asked to design a five spread magazine
              article for print. The goal of this project is to practice our
              layout, communication and typographic skills. After discussion, we
              decided to use “relationship between human and animals” as our
              topic. I established the overall design and take responsibility
              for final adjusting.

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              The first step is to research individually and make our own choice
              of titles, fonts, and photos. When it came to fonts selection, a
              challenge for me is to balance their weight, scale, style. It has
              to be conservative enough to look like a magazine font and special
              enough to catch the audiences’ eyes. I selected my fonts and
              photos simultaneously because they need to be coherent. I think
              vintage pictures look good with serif fonts.

            src="img/p1-2.jpg"
            alt="fonts style guide"

          <div class="flex-c-r">
            <h3>Sketching</h3>
            <p>
              Then I sketched possible print layouts. By researching, I learned
              how magazine spreads look like, how they are different from other
              graphic design, what layouts are suitable for opening, middle and
              ending pages.

          <div class="flex-c-r">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
              One challenge was to make spreads on InDesign based on the
              agreement of selection. The real challenges are to learn the
              software and place the elements in the right place. The hierarchy,
              grid structure, and white space were confusing for my first time
              designing magazine.

          <h3>EVALUATION</h3>
          <p>
            After multiple adjustments, and conquering different challenges, the
            final design is pretty consistent overall. My favorite spreads are
            the beginning and ending. The remaining spreads are a little bit
            weak on grid structure. From this project, I learned to create flows
            to lead readers and manipulating important lines and whitespace to
            create hierarchy and aesthetic unity.
