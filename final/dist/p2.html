              In a group of 2, we were asked to build a website that visualize
              information and data. The purpose of our website is to educate the
              public about the life cycle of a milk cow.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              When I first started on this project, one of the processes that
              took a while for me to become accustomed to was the iterative
              process. Previously, a project would typically have a first and
              second draft, and then you submit the final. For this one, the
              standard to this process usually worked its way to 5 – 10 versions
              before it would come close to nearing its final iteration. At
              first, I found it frustrating that there were tiny details I would
              personally be fine with, but would be picked out by my professor.
              I have come to love this process because it is these questions and
              nit-picking that made me recognize the potential and flaws in my
              work. By iterating, it only makes for a better final product.

            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>
              In order to organize our content, things such as the labels of
              each piece of content and how if fits within the website
              wireframe, are important. Good usability is always the priority.
              Rather than “Introduction” “About” etc., we want more descriptive
              labels like “Milk Production” “Milk Alternatives” to let our user
              know what to expect after clicking. We may use icons to enhance
              the visual.

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              A design challenge would be finding a way of representing the data
              and information in a clear and concise way. In a way that would
              help the audience to understand the information easily, as a long
              and boring paragraph can often be hard to digest, and we can lose
              audiences.
              <br />
              Because using a giant block of words can lose audiences, instead,
              we used icons and infographics to help the reader quickly
              understand the information. Not only is this a good way to deliver
              the information, but it is also aesthetically pleasing.

          <h3>EVALUATION</h3>
          <p>
            The most interesting thing about developing these pages were the
            organizational aspects of it. With the site theme that was in use,
            sometimes content blocks and pages were not entirely intuitive in
            terms of site-flow and its relationship to parent or child pages.
            This meant that a lot of code like CSS had be edited elsewhere,
            depending on where the page was situated in the site hierarchy.
            Thankfully, I have my Ta and Professor was able to jump in and guide
            me through obstacles I had. Discussing with my teamate, I learned
            how to offers various solutions to the single problem.
